# whealbiCode - under construction
Custom source code, workflows and jupyter notebooks used in the analysis of the wheat genotypes sequenced in the Whealbi Project

# Analysis Workflow
1. [Raw Data Processing and Variant Calling](variant_calling/)
2. [Geographical components of the panel structure (Figure 2A)](monophyly_permutation/)
3. [Geographical components of the panel structure (Figure 2B)](ancestral_region_simulations/)
4. [Computation of nucleotide diversity Ï€ (Figure 3)](Nucleotide_diversity_computation/)
5. [Studying the Phylogeny and Reticulate Evolution of the Wheat Species Complex using Repeated Random Haplotype Sampling (RRHS; Figure 4)](RRHS_network/)
6. [Inference of Hybridization and Introgression Events using ABBA-BABBA (Figure 4)](ABBA-BABBA/)
