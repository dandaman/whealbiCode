# whealbiCode - under construction
Custom source code, workflows and jupyter notebooks used in the analysis of the wheat genotypes sequenced in the Whealbi Project

# Analysis Workflow
1. Raw Data Processing and Variant Calling
2. Studying the Phylogeny and Reticulate Evolution of the Wheat Species Complex using Repeated Random Haplotype Sampling (RRHS)
3. Inference of Hybridization and Introgression Events using ABBA-BABBA

## ancestral_region_simulations/

Code and data to simulate hexaploid wheat ancestral region of origin ; used for figure4B.

## monophyly_permutation/

Code and data for the permutation tests to test the grouping of three character : continent of origin, growth habit, and historical group.
